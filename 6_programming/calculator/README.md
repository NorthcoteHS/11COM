# calculator

Your task is to create a simple calculator that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, x, รท), and computes and outputs the result.

## Steps

1. Always start by copying and renaming `template.html` for the current module.

    - Name the file `calculator.html` in this module's directory.

2. Create three `<input>` elements to get the two numbers and the operation from the user.

    - How will you tell the users what each input does?
    - How will they choose the operation? Will they choose from a dropdown? Or maybe type in the word 'plus', or the symbol '+'?

3. Create a button to perform the correct operation and compute the result.

    - To make the button "do" something, you will need to add an `onclick` attribute and write a JavaScript function for it to call.
    - In your JS function, you will need to get the contents of each input, and use if statements to perform the correct operation.

4. Display the result to the user.

    - How will you display it? An alert box is easy, but it would look nicer for the answer to actually be displayed on the page.
    - Remember to indicate what the number means, like `The answer is: `

5. Use the resources below to guide you through the process.

## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | Successfully adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers |
| Silver | Displays the result on the page rather than as an alert |
| Gold   | More operations, multiple numbers, error-proofing, etc. |
