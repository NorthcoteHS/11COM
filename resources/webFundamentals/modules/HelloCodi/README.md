# HelloCodi

[HelloCodi](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hello-codi.html) was your first creation in App Inventor. It involved three pieces: a button with an image, a text field, and a sound that played when the button was clicked.

Your task is to recreate HelloCodi for the web. There are three main components to any web app or webpage:

1. **HTML:** The skeleton of your code, where you define your content, but *not* how it looks or behaves. This is like dragging elements from the "Palette" in App Inventor.
2. **CSS:** The styles where you define the appearance of your elements, much like changing the properties in the App Inventor "Designer".
3. **JavaScript:** The behaviour of your code. This is like the "Blocks Editor" in App Inventor.

## Steps

1. Before attempting this module, you should have completed [`HelloWorld`](../HelloWorld/).

2. Begin by downloading `template.html` to your working directory, and renaming it `HelloCodi.html`.

    - to download a file from GitHub, first click on its link, then **right-click on `Raw`** and "Save link as..."

3. Use the resources below to create buttons, text, sound, and interactivity.
