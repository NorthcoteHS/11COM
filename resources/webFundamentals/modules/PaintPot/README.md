# PaintPot

In PaintPot ([Part 1](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/paintpot-part1.html) and [Part 2](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/paintpot-part2.html)), you learned how to draw on a canvas and use variables.

Your task is to recreate PaintPot for the web. To do so, you will have to learn about HTML5 canvases.

## Steps

1. Before attempting this module, you should have completed [`HelloWorld`](../HelloWorld/) and [`HelloCodi`](../HelloCodi/).

2. Begin by downloading [`template.html`](./template.html) to your working directory, and renaming it `PaintPot.html`.

    - to download a file from GitHub, first click on its link, then **right-click on `Raw`** and "Save link as..."

3. Place three buttons (Red/Blue/Green), a canvas, and three more buttons (Wipe, Big dots, Small dots) in your HTML, and give them appropriate sizes/styles.

4. Use the resources below to guide the rest of the process.

## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | Clicking and dragging the mouse draws accurate lines on the canvas (only while the mouse button is pressed down) |
| Silver | Dots, colours, and wipe working |
| Gold   | Different sizes of dots and lines, ability to choose background image, etc. |

- **Note:** all code should be commented and you should have no redundant code

At the end of each day, submit a zip of your entire working directory (including this module) on MyNHS.
