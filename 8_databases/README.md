# Unit 8: Databases

For our final project of the year, we are developing software solutions that involve databases. Full instructions and assignment materials are avaialable in class.

## PHP Templates

In this folder, there are two sets of PHP template files:

|Set      |SQL-Insert                                   |SQL-Query                                  |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Redirect |[insert-redirect.php](./insert-redirect.php) |[query-redirect.php](./query-redirect.php) |
|Async    |[insert-async.php](./insert-async.php)       |[query-async.php](./query-async.php)       |

See your SAC 6 booklet for a more detailed description of the two options. When you have chosen whether you want to use the "redirect" or "async" method, copy the template files and use your text editor to modify them for your purposes.

Lines that need editing are clearly marked with comments that start with `STUDENTS`.

## Demos

You can also see both methods in action by looking at the `demo-async` and `demo-redirect` folders. Note that you can only look at the code - you won't be able to run these on your own computers unless you install a PHP and SQL server, and set up the SQL server with the right DBs and users.

Ultimately we will be putting your projects onto the class server (Raspberry Pi), where the PHP and SQL will be working as intended!
