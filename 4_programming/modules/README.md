# More module ideas

Feel free to use any of the below ideas as inspiration, or come up with your own completely unique idea for a module!

If you would like to add ideas to the list, please ask your teacher how! We gladly welcome contributions. You are also able to earn credit by creating your own detailed module description, with full resources and instructions, in place of submitting a program. This is an advancement option and must be discussed with your teacher first.

## Real-world

- a shop "point-of-sale" system, where you can select what items you want to purchase (and how many), and it will calculate the total price
    - consider adding options like a "members discount", or bulk discounts for buying several of the same item, etc.
- a mall directory (or other map), with an image and a list, and hovering over the list item highlights the appropriate area of the map
- a user lookup system, e.g. entering a person's name will return their phone number, address, or other information
    - remember to account for names that aren't found in the system!
- a library catalogue system, that takes information about a book and generates an appropriate shelving code (using Dewey Decimal or similar)

## Personal

- a to-do list program that lets you record things you want to do later
    - maybe you can rank the urgency of each item, and the list will sort automatically
    - note that with your current knowledge you will not be able to make a *persistent* program - that is, any items you enter will disappear when you refresh the page
    - you could try to save the list out as a text file, and have a way to import it again, to make it more persistent
- an app to keep track of your favourite music (or books, foods, phone brands, anything)
    - maybe you can click on an artist and it brings up a list of their best songs, or albums with pictures and dates, etc.
    - or some way to rate each item and sort
- bicycle repair info - maybe it shows a picture of a bike, and clicking on the different parts brings up specific information

## School

- homework tracker - like the to-do list, but specific to homework, with due dates
- a Study Buddy - you pre-program a list of quiz questions (e.g. to prepare for a test), and it presents them to you randomly, checking if your answer is correct
- a quiz - like the Study Buddy, but laid out with all questions on a page, not random
- a formula calculator, pre-programmed with specific formulas for physics or maths
- a word counter, that takes a long string and reports the number of words (useful for English class)
    - could extend it - number of characters, sentences, etc.

## Games

- a text adventure game: it describes where you are (without any graphics), and lets you issue commands by typing them
    - you'll need to map out the options for each room
    - standard options are "look" (and "look [object]"), "go [direction]", "take [object]", "use [object]", etc.
- a "random clicker" game, which spawns images at random locations on the screen that you have to click on
    - you could make it interesting by giving a score based on a user's speed
- a number guesser - the program picks a random number, and the user needs to guess it
    - the program could give feedback like "Too high!" or "Too low!", and have a limit on number of guesses

## Tools

- a random name (or URL) generator - click on the button and it comes up with your next website name!
- a random list picker - given a list, it picks a random value and displays it
    - for instance a list of people's names, and it chooses who goes first in a game
- an image editor, like Paint, that lets you draw on a canvas
- a text editor, like Word, that has tools to change the font/size/colour/etc of text you've typed
- an ASCII Art generator that converts what you type into a larger ASCII Art version
