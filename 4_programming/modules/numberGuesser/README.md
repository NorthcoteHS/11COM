# numberGuesser

Your task is to create a basic number guessing game. The computer generates a number and the player has to guess it. The computer then responds with either higher or lower.

## Steps

1. Open Brackets. In your GH folder, **pull from upstream** to get the latest changes, then create a new file.

    - Save the new file as `numberGuesser.html` in *this directory* (`GH/4_programming/modules/numberGuesser/`).
    - Fill out the basic structure of the HTML from memory, or use a template or past project.

2. Create one `<input>` element to get the user guess and a `<button>` element to submit the guess.

3. Create an area on the screen to display the computers response (you could also use the `alert()` function).

2. In your JavaScript create a function that generates the random number (be sure to the the user what range they are guessing)

4. You will also need to create another function that handles the user submitting their guess

5. Inside your Submit function, get the value of the users guess and then see if it is higher, lower or equal to the computers guess and respond accordingly.
