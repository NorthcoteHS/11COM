# Magic8Ball

In [Magic8Ball](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/magic-8-ball.html), you learned how to use lists and random values to generate a new response each time the button was clicked.

Your task is to recreate Magic8Ball for the web. To do so, you will have to learn about arrays (the JavaScript version of a list). 

## Steps

1. Before attempting this module, you should have completed [`HelloWorld`](../HelloWorld/) and [`HelloCodi`](../HelloCodi/).

2. Begin by downloading `template.html` to your working directory, and renaming it `Magic8Ball.html`.

    - to download a file from GitHub, first click on its link, then **right-click on `Raw`** and "Save link as..."

3. Use the resources below to guide the rest of the process.

## Resources

| Requirement   | Resource |
|---------------|----------|
| Button, Sound | <ul><li>See [HelloCodi](../HelloCodi/) for guidance on buttons and sounds</li></ul> |
| Arrays        | <ul><li>[JavaScript arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) (look at "Creating" and "Access the Elements")</li><li>[JavaScript random](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp) (in particular, "random integers")</li><li>getting a random array value - try [Google](https://www.google.com.au/)!</li></ul> |
| Response      | <ul><li>Option 1: [JS alert box](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp)</li><li>Option 2: [Changing HTML content](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_html.asp)</li></ul> |
| General       | <ul><li>[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)</li><li>[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)</li><li>[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)</li><li>[11COM Resources](/resources/)</li></ul> |


## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | Button causes an alert-box with a random response |
| Silver | Button changes an existing element's contents to display the response |
| Gold   | Able to enter the question, and the program recognises "key phrases" to which it gives unique responses |

- **Note:** all code should be commented and you should have no redundant code

At the end of each day, submit a zip of your entire working directory (including this module) on MyNHS.
