## Core 2: Creating the Survey

### Variables

To test a hypothesis we need to think carefully about what variables we need to measure.

These might be variables that directly answer our hypothesis, or others that might affect the outcome but are less obvious.
See below for an example.

> ##### Example: What are people's favourite subjects?
>**Hypothesis:** Younger students prefer science and older students prefer English.
<br/>
**Direct variables:** Favourite subject, Age
<br/>
**Other useful variables:** Least favourite subject (or rank each subject), Gender, Parents' profession, Age of siblings...

Choose one of your hypotheses and list *all* variables you will need to measure.

| 1. Chosen hypothesis |
| 2. Direct variables |
| 3. Other useful variables |

### Informed Consent

Often in research, it is necessary to provide detailed information to participants about the purpose and methods of your investigation.
For this assignment, your survey must begin with a participant information statement which fully explains:

- the investigation you are conducting;
- the purpose of the data being collected;
- how the data will be stored;
- who will have access to the data;
- where the findings will be published.

Create a draft of an information statement that will serve as the first page of your survey.

| 4. Participant information statement |

### Survey

Using [Google Forms](https://www.google.com.au/forms/about/), create a survey to collect all of the variables and information you have outlined.
Once drafted, you will submit your survey as a link and also add your teacher as a collaborator, so they can view the design.

Remember that your form must begin with informed consent (previous step).
One easy way to accomplish this is to:

- create multiple "sections"
- on your first section, place the information statement as a "Checkbox" question
- have only one checkbox answer, "I consent to the collection of my data." or similar
- make the section "required" (meaning they have to check the box to proceed)

| 6. Invitation to collaborate (Settings -> Add collaborators -> `koopmans.erik.m@edumail.vic.gov.au`)
