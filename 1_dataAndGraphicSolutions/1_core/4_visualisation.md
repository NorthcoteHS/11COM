# Data and Graphic Solutions

## Core 4: Visualisation

This is it!
The last step: visualising our results.

### Graphic solutions

At the end of Core 3, you planned out your graphic solutions.
Begin here by listing those graphics you want to display (e.g. bar chart of favourite colour).

Then, gather those graphics!
Some of them might come directly from Google Forms (screenshot/print-screen and crop).
Others might be charts or graphs you create in Excel.
When they're ready, submit all of your individual graphics.

| 1. List of graphics to use |
| 2. All individual graphics (combined as a zip file, or collated onto a single Word file etc.) |

### Infographic

An infographic is a colourful, eye-catching way of combining data and text.
Think of it like a flashy poster.
Consider these two examples:

- [Girl Summit 2014](files/Infographic_GirlSummit2014.png) ([src](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/16332918541))
- [PRM Year in Review 2016](files/Infographic_PRM2016.jpeg) ([src](https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/prm/about/265946.htm))

Notice the grid structure, the use of size, font, and icons to emphasise important details, the short title, the tall vertical layout.
These are all important aspects of the infographic design.

Use these examples and others on the Internet to design your own infographic.
Make sure the information is *complete* and *accurate*, and that it is focused on your original hypothesis.
Try to tell a story - your reader should be able to look at your infographic and clearly understand your message.

You may find these resources useful for eye-catching icons:

- [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Google Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/)

You are free to use any software you like.
You may want to use an online infographic creator like [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/formats/infographics/),
a graphic editor (eg. Photoshop or Illustrator),
or your standard word editor (eg. MS Word).

Note that MS Powerpoint is another popular tool for poster creation (using a single "slide"),
and may let you control how things are positioned more easily than Word or similar.

### Formats and conventions

There are many formats and conventions we try to follow when creating visualisations.
These include:

    - Titles
    - Text styles
    - Shapes
    - Lines and arrows
    - Sources of data and legend
    - Colours and contrasts

Choose two and describe how you have incorporated these formats and conventions into your infographic.
