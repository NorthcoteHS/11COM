## Core 1: Research Question and Hypothesis

Our main goal for this unit is to learn how to gather data and interpret it with visualisations.

Before we can begin, we need to have a *reason* for collecting data.
In other words we need to frame an **inquiry**, which follows the four steps of the scientific method:

1. Ask a research question
2. Generate hypotheses
3. Experiment
4. Interpret results

On this assignment, you will be completing the first two steps: asking a research question and generating hypotheses.

### Research question

Research starts by asking a question.
Research questions can be about absolutely *anything*, but that doesn't mean every research question is good.
To quote Robert M. Pirsig (*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*):

> ... the main skill is in stating absolutely no more than you are positive you know.
It is much better to enter a statement "Solve Problem: Why doesn't cycle work?" which
sounds dumb but is correct, than it is to enter a statement "Solve Problem: What is
wrong with the electrical system?" when you don't absolutely know the trouble is in the
electrical system. What you should state is "Solve Problem: What is wrong with cycle?"
and *then* state as the first entry of Part Two: "Hypothesis Number One: The trouble is
in the electrical system." You think of as many hypotheses as you can, then you design
experiments to test them to see which are true and which are false.

Use a blank paper or document to brainstorm research questions.
When you are satisfied, choose **three** options that you would be interested to research as a project.

| 1. Research questions (3 options) |

### Hypotheses

With a hypothesis, we propose possible answers to our research question.
*We are guessing at the answer without any evidence!*

There are an infinite number of hypotheses for every research question, so our job is to come up with several and pick the one that seems most promising.
We will then collect data to see if we were right (testing the hypothesis).

Pick one of your research questions from above and generate **three** hypotheses that might explain the answer.

**Note:** If you can't come up with 3 hypotheses, it may be a problem with your research question!
"What", "Why", and "How" are ideal questions - anything with only a yes or no answer is too specific.

| 3. Hypotheses (3 options) |

When you are finished, reflect on your hypotheses. Does one stand out?
Remember, it should be something you can *test* and prove to be either true or false with data.
When you're satisfied, choose the **one** hypothesis you will build a survey to test.
