## Extended 4: Mockup

A mockup is a sketch of how your desired product will appear.
It is a very useful tool when designing any visual product.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this task, you should have finished:

| Prerequisites |
|---|
| Core 3 |
| (Complete *before* Core 4) |

### Annotated mockup

In Core 3, you planned what components you want for your infographic.
As a next step, create a mockup of the infographic - a sketch of how it will appear.
It does not need to be accurate (e.g. pie charts don't need to show the actual data),
but the layout and appearance should be representative of your goal.

As a second step, make sure that the mockup is *annotated*,
by drawing arrows to each component that will have any special styling or other details.
For instance, you might annotate your title as "Large, bold, centred".
It is best to write annotations outside of the mockup itself, using arrows and a different colour.

If you create a paper mock-up, submit by scanning or taking a photo.
