## Extended 2: Data Types

Our ability to analyse and visualise data depends on the type of data we collect.
Here we will consider our data - what type it is, how we will collect it, and what validation needs to be performed.

### Prerequisites

Before completing **Extended 2**, you should have finished:

| Prerequisites |
|---|
| Core 1 |
| Core 2 Part 1 (Variables) |

### Data table

Create a table of the data items that need to be collected for the investigation (from **Core 2**).
For each item, indicate:

- whether it is quantitative or qualitative
- the response type you will use when designing your survey
- any necessary validation rules

If you are unsure about response type and validation, explore the options in Google Forms closely.

| Data Item | Qualitative/Quantitative | Response type | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| e.g. Participant age | Quantitative | Text input ("short answer") | Number > 0 |
|   |   |   |&nbsp; |
|   |   |   |&nbsp; |
|   |   |   |&nbsp; |

| To submit |
|---|
| 1. Data table with quant/qual, response type, and validation |

### Measurement scales

Qualitative vs. quantitative is a useful distinction, but there is another common way of dividing data:

- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval
- Ratio

Research and *very briefly* describe the difference between these four categories, and give an example of each.
Then, make a second copy of your data table, but replace the "quant/qual" column with "N/O/I/R", and indicate the category of each data item.

If you're unsure where to start, try [this resource](https://www.mymarketresearchmethods.com/types-of-data-nominal-ordinal-interval-ratio/).

| To submit |
|---|
| 2. Very brief description of the difference between N/O/I/R, with an example of each |
| 4. Second data table, with quant/qual replaced by N/O/I/R |
