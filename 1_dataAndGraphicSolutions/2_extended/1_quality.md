## Extended 1: Factors Affecting the Quality of Data

There are several factors that affect the quality of data. For this topic, we will focus on:

- Relevance
- Accuracy
- Freedom from bias

### Prerequisites

Before completing **Extended 1**, you should have finished:

| Prerequisites |
|---|
| Core 1 |
| Core 2 Part 1 (Variables) |

### Relevance and accuracy

Begin by researching the terms "relevance" and "accuracy", and write a *1-sentence* summary of each in the context of collecting data.

| To submit |
|---|
| 1. 1-sentence summary of relevance. |
| 2. 1-sentence summary of accuracy. |

### Bias

Bias is any factor that may cause your data to be unreliable or unfair based on unevenly weighting information.
These include:

- Experimenter bias
- Selection bias
- Response bias
- Recency bias
- Recall bias
- Measurement bias
- Publication bias
- Small sample size

Briefly define four types of bias that can occur in research.
Then, **using your variables from Core 2**, identify how bias might affect the quality of the data you are collecting and describe a way you will attempt to overcome this bias.
If you are struggling with this step, consider the difference in **selection bias** between surveying the whole school vs. surveying only our class.

| 3. Definitions of 4 types of bias |
| 4. Analysis of bias |
