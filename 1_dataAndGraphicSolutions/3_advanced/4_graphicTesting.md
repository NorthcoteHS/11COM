# Data and Graphic Solutions

## Advanced 4: Testing Graphic Solutions

Here we will explore two important design tools for creating and testing our results.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this task, you should have finished:

| Prerequisites |
|---|
| Core 3 |
| Core 4 (for Part 2) |

### IPO chart

In computing (and design in general), we often have inputs and want to get to a desired output.
For instance, you may have information about students' favourite colours, and you want to create a visualisation of the results.

The IPO chart (IPO = Input Process Output) is a formal design tool for representing this process.
It is a table in which you list your inputs (raw data) on the left, desired output on the right, and any necessary processing steps to get there in the middle.

Using our example above:

| Input | Process | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Favourite colour | <ul><li>Tally results in each category</li><li>Create chart of results</li></ul> | Bar chart of preferences |
| Age, favourite colour | Tally results separately for each age group | 2-way table showing age and preferences |

At the end of Core 3, you planned your visualisations and did the necessary manipulations to your data.
*Go back* and choose at least two of your manipulations, and describe them using an IPO chart.

| To submit |
|---|
| 1. IPO chart with at least two manipulations |

### Test table

Another important design tool is the test table.
This lets us plan our goals before creating a solution, then test the final product to make sure it achieves those goals.

When creating a graphic solution, it is important it meets these expectations:

    - Accuracy
    - Communication of message
    - Completeness
    - Reliability
    - Presentation
    - Relevance

Use the test table below to evaluate your graphic solution.

| Test | Test data | Expected result | Actual result (include evidence) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | Primary data collected | Results shown in the solution are exactly the same as the data collected | |
| Communication of message | Primary data collected | The results of the data collected are clear for the user to identify in the solution | |
| Completeness | Primary data collected | All of the valid data collected has been included in the solution | |
| Reliability | Primary data collected | The source of the data used in the solution has been verified | |
| Presentation | Primary data collected | The data has been presented in a way that it is attractive and clear to the user | |
| Relevance | Primary data collected | Only data relevant for the investigation is included in the solution | &nbsp; |


| To submit |

| 2. Test table with actual results and evidence |
