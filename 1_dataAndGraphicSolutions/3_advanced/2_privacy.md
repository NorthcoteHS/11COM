## Advanced 2: Privacy

When collecting data, we must be mindful to do so ethically.
There are often laws in place to protect people's privacy when their personal information is collected.
In Australia this includes the Australian Privacy Principles (APP).
Description to come.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this task, you should have finished:

| Prerequisites |

### APP

For our purposes, the two relevant sections of the APP are Principle 2 and Principle 6.
Research articles about the APP (or the APP documents themselves) to provide a *brief* summary of each principle (bullet points or less than 5 sentences).
