Often it is necessary to keep a record of our participants.
For instance in a scientific study, names and contact details must be maintained,
along with payment records, consent, and any other official documentation.

In these circumstances, we still need to "de-identify" our data.
Describe one strategy we could use to de-identify, and any ethical concerns with the solution.
